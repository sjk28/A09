	<p>New York Times columnist and author, Andrew Ross Sorkin, has been described as the most famous financial
		journalist
		of his generation. His book, <i>Too Big to Fail</i>, was the first behind-the-scenes account of the financial
		crisis
		that
		led to our current recession.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The Economist, The Financial Times, and Business Week all named <i>Too Big To Fail</i> one of the best books of
		the
		year.
		The book was published by Viking October 20, 2009. The book was adapted as a movie by HBO Films and premiered on
		HBO
		on May 23, 2011.</p>

	<h2>Movie reviews</h2>
	<br>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px;">"Lots of heat but not very much light. It came across as a kind of daytime soap opera
		version showing the
		personalities of the players rather than dealing with the nuts and bolts of what really happened. Even that
		would
		not have been so bad but the movie tries to portray lots of these folks as sympathetic figures just trying to do
		the
		right thing."</p>
	<br>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px;">"I am watching this for the 3rd time, trying to understand how this large group of
		capitalist pigs could royally
		screw their families, descendants, neighbors, countrymen and the rest of the whole world with absolutely no
		compassion."</p>
